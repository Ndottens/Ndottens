### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nick Ottens and I'm a 23-year-old backend developer from the Netherlands. 

I have a passion for Laravel and Magento2, and I specialize in building custom webshops using these technologies. I have a strong background in PHP development and have been working with Laravel and Magento2 for several years. 

In my current role as Backend Developer at [Elgentos](https://github.com/elgentos), I am responsible for building new features and improving the backend systems of our company's webshops and [Signalise](https://github.com/signalise-io). In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the world of web development.

Thanks for checking out my bio! :hugs:
